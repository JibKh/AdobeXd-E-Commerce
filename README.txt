Welcome to my AdobeXd designs by Jibran Khalil :)

I have designed an E-Commerce appication using AdobeXd and shared the screenshots here alongside the working files. 
The screenshots can be opened here on github without having to download them, so do check them out!

This is part of the design stage for developing our cross platform application as part of our university course project.
